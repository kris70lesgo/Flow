# AegisFlow — Devpost submission

## Name

AegisFlow

## Elevator pitch

Everyone is selling you an autonomous agent. AegisFlow makes the opposite bet: when
a critical supplier fails, the AI does the four hours of investigation — then stops.
A human keeps the pen.

## The problem (real, and expensive)

When a single-source supplier of a critical component goes down, a cross-functional
scramble begins. Procurement, operations, quality, and legal pull fragmented facts
from contracts, certificates, supplier sites, news, and internal systems, then try
to verify claims and choose an alternative — in a shared spreadsheet, under revenue
pressure. The failure modes: slow decisions, missed contradictions, and commitments
made on unverified supplier claims. One missed 8-day stockout on a $2.4M line dwarfs
any software budget.

## What we built

A working incident-response workspace. One click runs a live investigation:

1. **Analyst** frames the disruption.
2. **Web intelligence** (SerpApi) runs one query per supplier plus market/news queries.
   Zero corroboration is recorded as a *negative* signal, not ignored.
3. **Document intelligence** (Nutrient) extracts text and fields from six supplier PDFs.
3b. **Domain footprint** (name.com) asks whether each supplier owns the domain it would
   trade under. A company trading since 2018 registered its domain; a purchasable one
   is scored as absence of commercial footprint.
4. **Verification** runs named rules over the extracted fields. `entity-age-vs-registry`
   compares the founding year a supplier claims publicly against the `FORMED` date on
   its registration; `certificate-registry-match` checks a certificate against its
   registry match, its issuer's accreditation, and its expiry. No verdict is keyed on a
   document id — edit the PDF and the verdict changes.
5. **Risk engine** scores each alternative on six transparent dimensions, each citing
   its evidence. Judges can re-weight the model live on the "Why this recommendation?"
   screen — and even maxing the cost weight cannot make a conflicted supplier win.
6. **Decision** produces an evidence-backed recommendation with confidence, risks,
   and unknowns.

Then it stops. Approve / reject / request-more-evidence are human-only transitions,
enforced in the state machine (`HUMAN_ONLY_TARGETS`), not by prompt. On approval:
Doctavian generates the Emergency Supplier Transition Agreement from the structured
decision payload, Nutrient stamps it **PENDING HUMAN SIGNATURE**, and Foxit creates
the eSign session — only after two independent gates pass: the named `assertHumanMaySign`
guard, and a tool registry that classifies eSign as the one IRREVERSIBLE operation.

Every sponsor API call — live, local fallback, or seeded — is recorded in an open
**Integration Activity Ledger** (`/integrations`) with its real request and response.
Nothing is faked: every data path is tagged `LIVE`, `LOCAL`, or `DEMO SEEDED`.

## The golden scenario

`INC-1042`: Pacific Components Ltd. fails; PX-17 Power Controller at risk; 8 days of
inventory; $2.4M exposure. Three alternatives. The cheapest, Shenzhen Rapid Parts
(0.85× baseline), claims "Established 2018" — but its business registration shows
2021 and its ISO 9001 certificate has no registry match. AegisFlow discovers the
contradiction in the extracted document text, marks the claims `CONFLICT` /
`UNVERIFIED`, and refuses to treat them as verified. Recommended supplier: Nexus
Manufacturing, on delivery evidence and clean verification.

## How the judging criteria are met

- **Progress:** end-to-end working app — six agents, SSE-streamed investigation,
  transparent risk engine with live re-weighting, human-in-the-loop state machine,
  six real sponsor integrations each with an honest fallback, 67 passing tests,
  `next build` green.
- **Concept:** a real, board-level problem (supply-chain disruption response) with a
  sharp wedge — the analyst who lives in the disruption "war-room" spreadsheet.
- **Feasibility:** procurement/ops SaaS; Team and Enterprise tiers; the cost of one
  missed disruption dwarfs the subscription. Full business case at `/business`.

## Per-challenge write-ups

### SerpApi — Best AI Use Case
AegisFlow uses live web search for **verification**, not retrieval. It runs one query
per candidate supplier (registry, certification) plus market and disruption-news
queries. A live call that returns **zero** organic results is a first-class outcome —
recorded in the ledger and fed into the risk model as absence of corroboration. This
is the novel bit: the AI treats what it *cannot* find as evidence.

### Nutrient — Turn Documents Into Something People Actually Trust
Nutrient DWS is load-bearing on **both ends**. On ingestion, `extract-text` pulls the
fields that every claim's provenance points back to (document + field + mode). On
output, the `build` pipeline stamps the generated agreement **PENDING HUMAN
SIGNATURE** before any human sees it. "Trust" here is literal: every fact in the UI
links to the Nutrient-extracted field it came from.

### Doctavian — Generate It Right. Sign It Tight.
The Emergency Supplier Transition Agreement is generated from a **structured,
Zod-validated decision payload** — not a free-text prompt. The decision → payload →
document chain is visible in the UI, and the payload carries the evidence summary
(verified count, conflict count, confidence) into the contract itself.

We use Doctavian's actual document-request model rather than treating it as string
interpolation: the template and the decision payload are uploaded as files, generation
ties the two URNs together, and the result is fetched by document URN. Both credentials
the gateway requires are wired — the `X-Api-Key` subscription key and the Microsoft
OAuth2 bearer.

The template itself is generated in code from Doctavian's Element syntax, which let us
put the product thesis into the artefact: an `mdoc:paragraph` reveals an
unverified-claims notice **only** when the run recorded a conflict. Same template,
`conflicts: 1` prints the notice, `conflicts: 0` hides it — verified against the live
API. The agreement discloses its own evidence position on its face.

### Foxit — Your Agent Shouldn't Sign That
This is the whole product thesis, and Foxit drew the line first: their MCP server
exposes ~40 **reversible** PDF operations as agent tools, and signing is deliberately
excluded — to put a document in front of a signer you have to leave the tool sandbox
and call eSign directly. We turned that API-design opinion into an enforced property
of the application.

`lib/state/agent-tools.ts` registers every document operation with a risk class
(REVERSIBLE / IRREVERSIBLE) and the actors permitted to invoke it. `esign.createFolder`
is the only irreversible entry: HUMAN-only, valid from exactly one state.
`tests/agent-tools.test.ts` enumerates every actor × every workflow state and asserts
that no non-human combination can reach it. A finite-state machine and the named
`assertHumanMaySign(actor, state)` guard hold the same line independently.

The eSign integration creates the signing folder via
`POST https://na1.fusion.foxit.com/esign/api/v1/folders/createfolder` with
`sendNow: false`, authenticated with the unified platform's `client_id` /
`client_secret` sent as headers. Verified against the live API: it returns a folder in
`DRAFT` status with a real `folderId`, and emails no one — the agent prepares the
envelope, a human decides whether it ever goes out.

### name.com — Domain API Challenge
A manufacturer that has traded for eight years has a website, and a website means
somebody registered the domain. So "is this supplier's domain still available to buy?"
is really "does this supplier exist commercially?" — and one `checkAvailability` call
answers it.

That makes name.com the **third independent line of evidence** on the same
contradiction: the business registration says 2021, the ISO certificate has no registry
match, and `shenzhenrapidparts.com` is unregistered. A supplier can forge a PDF; getting
all three to agree is much harder. A purchasable domain feeds the risk model as a
negative signal, exactly as a zero-result SerpApi query does — absence is evidence.

With no credentials set, the app reports the registration states observed against public
DNS and tags them `DEMO SEEDED`. It reports what is true rather than inventing a better
story.

### Xano — Rebuild a SaaS Tool You Hate
The tool we hate: the disruption "war-room" spreadsheet every supply-chain team
maintains by hand. We rebuilt it on Xano as normalized `incident → supplier → claim`
tables plus an **append-only** `audit_event` stream. The repository pattern means
the same app runs on in-memory or Xano with one env var; the footer shows which.

## What we do not claim

No autonomous procurement. No legally guaranteed contracts. No perfect verification.
No invented savings figures. Demo suppliers are fictional and tagged. Market figures
in `/business` are order-of-magnitude framing, not audited data.

## Demo script (2–3 min)

1. **Cold open on the conflict.** `/incidents/INC-1042` → "Run Response". While it
   streams, say the one line: *"A supplier just failed. The AI is doing the four
   hours of investigation right now."*
2. **The money shot.** Land on the red **Evidence conflict** panel — four independent
   findings against the cheapest supplier: "Established 2018" vs registration 2021,
   an ISO cert with no registry match, near-zero web corroboration, and a company
   domain that is still available to buy. Each card names the rule that produced it.
   *"Four different systems disagree with this supplier. It will not be treated as
   verified."*
3. **Prove it isn't scripted.** `lib/agents/document-rules.ts` — no rule mentions a
   filename. Change `FORMED` in the registration PDF to 2018 and re-run: the conflict
   is gone. *"The engine detects the contradiction. It doesn't replay one."*
4. **Stress-test.** "Why this recommendation?" → drag the **Cost** weight to max.
   The conflicted supplier still loses. *"The model is transparent and you can't
   game it into a bad call."*
5. **The handoff.** Approve → the agreement generates (Doctavian), gets stamped
   PENDING HUMAN SIGNATURE (Nutrient), and the signing panel says: *"AegisFlow
   prepared this. Only an authorized human can sign it."* Sign as a human.
6. **Proof.** `/integrations` → every sponsor API call with its real request and
   response. `/audit` → the append-only trail. `/business` → why it's a company.
