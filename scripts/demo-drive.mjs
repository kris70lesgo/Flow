/**
 * Drive the AegisFlow demo for a screen recording, on a fixed schedule.
 *
 * Every scene has a start and end second that does not move. The script does its
 * work inside the scene and then waits out the remainder, so two runs produce the
 * same timings — which means you can write the voiceover BEFORE you record, then
 * read it against the clock.
 *
 *   node scripts/demo-drive.mjs --script       # print the schedule and exit
 *   node scripts/demo-drive.mjs                # record against the deployed site
 *   node scripts/demo-drive.mjs --local        # against localhost:3000
 *   node scripts/demo-drive.mjs --manual-sign  # pause so you click Sign yourself
 *   node scripts/demo-drive.mjs --rehearse     # half-length, to check it runs
 *   node scripts/demo-drive.mjs --delay 15     # seconds of lead-in (default 10)
 *   node scripts/demo-drive.mjs --no-wait      # skip the Enter prompt, close at end
 *   node scripts/demo-drive.mjs --from 6       # start at scene 6 (for a re-shoot)
 *   node scripts/demo-drive.mjs --ends 58,83,94  # override the remaining scene ends
 *
 * --from assumes the app is ALREADY in the state that scene expects (scene 6 needs
 * the incident at HUMAN_REVIEW). Use --ends to match an earlier take's real timings
 * so existing voiceover still lines up when the segment is spliced back in.
 *
 * First run downloads Chromium: npx playwright install chromium
 *
 * The one variable is the investigation itself (live APIs, usually 15-25s). Scene 3
 * budgets 40s for it. If it overruns, the script says so and later scenes shift —
 * rerun rather than fighting it.
